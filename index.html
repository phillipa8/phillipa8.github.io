        <p>My name is Phillip Anderson, and I am from Indonesia. I am currently a university student studying Information Science and Engineering at Ritsumeikan University. Born on January 12, 2002, I enjoy exploring different foods and playing video games in my free time. These hobbies provide a good balance to my academic life. I also have a dog who brings a lot of joy and companionship to my everyday routine, his name is Poco ^._.^.

Besides my hobbies, I have big dreams for the future. I want to become a good father, husband, and child, building a happy and supportive family. These personal goals are very important to me and motivate me alongside my career aspirations.

I am very interested in finance and economics, which I find fascinating and essential. I was an early adopter of cryptocurrency, and this sparked my excitement for digital finance. Currently, I am also a part-time trader, which allows me to apply my knowledge practically and stay updated with market trends. This early interest has driven me to understand more about how technology and money work together. I aim to combine my engineering skills with my knowledge of finance and economics to navigate the future landscape of my field. With this combined knowledge, I hope to make a positive impact in my career and contribute meaningfully to society. My goal is to bridge the gap between technology and finance, ensuring both personal and professional growth.</p>
